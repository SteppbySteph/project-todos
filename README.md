# Project Todos

This week's project was to build a to-do list with slices, reducers and actions from scratch. Furthermore keep practicing on useSelector and dispatching actions. 

## The problem

I had put a lot of time on the design rather then adding some more functionalities with javaScript. If I had more time I would try to practice more using conditional rendering with the '&&' syntax.
